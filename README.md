## Web Portfolio - First Project

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
This is my very first web portfolio â€” built as part of my learning journey in front-end development. It's simple, but I'm proud of how it turned out and excited to keep improving from here.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
# â€¢ Vue.js â€“ Main front-end framework
# â€¢ HTML & CSS â€“ Structure and styling
# â€¢ JavaScript â€“ For simple interactivity

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
Since this is my first portfolio project, it's not super fancy â€” but itâ€™s a solid start and Iâ€™ve learned a lot building it.
Iâ€™m planning to keep improving it and adding new things as I grow.

## ðŸ™Œ Thanks!
Thanks for checking out my project!
Feel free to leave feedback or suggestions â€” I'd really appreciate it. ðŸ˜Š
